I think we're all dying.

Bit by bit, piece by piece. I don't just mean that literally. 

Literally speaking, as pieces of us die new ones grow in their place. It's less of a slow, linear death, more of a cycle that keeps on going. Until one day, it runs out.
When I say we, I don't mean everyone around the world. I mean us, specifically.

We're dying.
